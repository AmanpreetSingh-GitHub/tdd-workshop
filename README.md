DRAFT

**Test Driven Development** (TDD) is a powerful software development practice for combining software design, unit testing, and coding in a continuous process to increase quality, maintainability, and productivity. Using the TDD approach, developers write programs in very short development cycles: first the developer writes a failing automated test case that defines a new function or improvement, then produces code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards. The developer repeats this process many times until the unit is complete and fully tested.

Shawn Wallace has about 20 years of software development under his belt.  He uses TDD on a daily basis. **He will demonstrate the basics, and to convey the subtle “test-infected” mindset that drives developers to appreciate, adopt, and even enjoy working this way.**

During this hands-on session, you’ll use labs (or “katas”) to practice the techniques. You will work on one or two code labs specifically crafted to encourage object-oriented thinking and design through test-first and merciless refactoring. You can use any IDE and language that you have available to you, as long as the micro-testing framework (e.g., JUnit, NUnit, rSpec) is also available. You will explore the TDD discipline at your own pace, in a low-stress environment, with frequent opportunity to get personalized assistance from Rob.
Laptop Required. Participants should have strong programming skills and be familiar with an object-oriented language and programming techniques. They should bring a laptop installed with their favorite programming language and IDE—and come prepared to write code. Rob can provide JUnit for Java and NUnit for any .NET language. For any other language choice (e.g., C++ or Ruby), you will need to install (and verify) your chosen xUnit framework prior to the tutorial.
Presenter:
Rob Myers is founder of Agile Institute and a founding member of the Agile Cooperative. Rob has twenty-six years of professional experience on software development teams, and has consulted for leading companies in aerospace, government, medical, software, and financial sectors. He has been training and coaching organizations in Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP) management and development practices since 1999. Courses include Essential Test-driven Development and Essential Agile Principles and Practices. Every course is a blend of enjoyable, interactive, hands-on labs—plus practical dialog toward preserving sanity in the workplace. Rob also performs short- and long-term coaching to encourage, solidify, and improve the team's agile practices.
Audience:
Developers who are interested in introducing TDD into their team’s tool-box of powerful Agile engineering practices. Perhaps they have tried to encourage the TDD discipline already, but want more first-person experience in order to address concerns back home. Participants should be proficient in a modern object-oriented language.
Presentation Format/Timing:
The emphasis will be on learning by doing. There will be some preliminary demonstration and discussion, but we will forgo lengthy debate in favor of spending enough time on the labs. Each participant will receive personal attention from me, particularly if I note a critical mis-interpretation of the TDD practices.

(30 min) I provide my TDD demo, to convey the basic practices and to convey the subtleties of the TDD "test-infected" mindset.
(45 min) We then do the coding lab: A kata that is simple on the surface, but drives participants to think about design almost immediately.
(10 min) A brief retrospective on this lab draws out all the critical lessons.
Learning outcomes
Learn how to use one of the xUnit family of testing frameworks (for this workshop, both JUnit and NUnit will be available).
Learn test-first as a thinking process.
Learn the advantages of automating micro-tests.
Learn how TDD has been known to reduce defect rates by 80%.
Learn merciless refactoring as a code design tool.
Learn how TDD enables Emergent Design and can improve architectural-change cycle times by up to 4000% (not a typo: four THOUSAND percent).
Learn why something as simple as a to-do list written on a 3x5 card is essential to success with TDD.
